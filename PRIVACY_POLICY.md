## 6. Use of Cookies

A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.
Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time.
The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.
For example, if you personalize Setten pages, or register with Setten site or services, a cookie helps Setten to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.

When you return to the same Setten website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Setten features that you customized.
