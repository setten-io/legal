## 11. Disputes

a.
Binding Arbitration: In the event that there is a dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to statutory or common law claims, the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of any provision of these Terms of Use, and the determination of the scope or applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy originating from these Terms of Use, but specifically excluding any dispute principally related to either party’s intellectual property (which such dispute will be resolved in litigation before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida), will be determined by arbitration in Miami, Florida before a single arbitrator.

b.
Service of Process: Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors).
Nothing in these Terms of Use will affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

c.
Class Waiver: To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the parties agrees that any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.
If for any reason a claim or dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or any of the transactions contemplated between the parties.

d.
Provision of an Award: Subject to the limitations of liability identified in these Terms of Use, the appointed arbitrators may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the laws of the State of Florida.
In making a determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term or provision of this Agreement.
The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned written decision with respect to the dispute (the "Award") to each party, who will promptly act in accordance with the Award.
Any Award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed in or enforced by a state or federal court located in Miami, Florida.
The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review.

e.
Fees: Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, the costs of the attendance of the arbitration reporter at the arbitration hearing, and the costs of the arbitration facility.
In any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and legal fees awards will be offset.

f.
Confidentiality: The parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the Award, except (i) as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, (ii) in connection with a court application as contemplated above for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an Award or its enforcement, (iii) our disclosure of the Award in confidential settlement negotiations, or (iv) as otherwise required by applicable laws.
The parties, witnesses, and arbitrator will treat as confidential and will not disclose to any third person (other than witnesses or experts) any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration hereunder, except as required by law or except if such evidence was obtained from the public domain or was otherwise obtained independently from the arbitration.

g.
Conflict of Rules: In the case of a conflict between the provisions of this Section 11 and the rules governing arbitration identified in Section 11.a, the provisions of this Section 11 will prevail.
If any provision of these Terms of Use to arbitrate is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law and all the other provisions will remain valid and enforceable.
